This is a Fondry VTT module that allows for simple monster sheet import via the 'view markdown' feature of Tetra-Cube monster builder.

Using Tetra-Cube you can create a custom DnD 5e monster sheet that can be easily imported into foundry

## Usage

To use this module simply create a monster on http://tetra-cube.com/dnd/dnd-statblock.html, save the monster and use the view markdown button to copy the markdown of the actor. Then you can jump into foundry when, with the module installed press the `Tetra Cube Import` from the actors directory and paste the markdown. If the code was valid then a your new monster will be automaticly open

## Instalation

Can be either installed from the module.json file available in the latest release or in the Foundry Module Browser.
